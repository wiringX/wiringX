 *  ATTENTION:
 *
 *  The intentional use of the driver does not work for the following reason:
 *  if the device is connected to a dedicated pin at CON6 of BananaPro, e.g. pin 7, then the corresponding GPIO is expected to be GPIO 1,
 *  or (according to Wiki) pin 13 is expected to correspond to GPIO 2.
 *  On the other hand, the driver uses (besides the memory mapped IO) the kernel interface /sys/class/gpio for "gpio-sunxi" platform.
 *  For Receicer devices, this kernel interface is used to read values in. But the GPIO number of that interface does NOT correspond
 *  to the expected GPIO according to the pin.
 *  Test have shown, that pin 7 at CON6 of BananaPro corresponds to gpio 4: the value can be get from /sys/class/gpio/gpio4/value
 *  Hence, a workaround (without modification of the driver) might be: use pin 7 to connect receiver, but configure GPIO 4 in pilight
 *  "433gpio": {
                        "sender": -1,
                        "receiver": 4
     }
 * This worked in case of receiver (IN direction), but probably does not work in case of sender, since sending (direction OUT) might use
 * memory mapped IO instead of  /sys/class/gpio/. But sending was not tested yet.
 * I guess that "gpio-sunxi" might not be the right kernel driver for BananaPro (basis: Bananian Linux Kernel version 3.4.113).
